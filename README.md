WIP GUI library for C++ using raylib as the graphics backend.
Currently I have Textboxes, Buttons, Checkboxes, Windows, and a very rudimentary WindowManager. 
I plan on expanding this to be compatible with raygui's themes (which specify color and font).
Other planned GUI elements are dropdown boxes, sliders, numeric input, scroll bar, and maybe a basic file dialog box.
The textbox is 95% bug free, but the textwrap and textresize features were very difficult to implement without some mishaps.

The code organization + non-existent documentation are currently not a problem, but I plan on improving those in the future.
